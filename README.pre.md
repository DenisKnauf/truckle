truckle and cave
================

`cave` is very powerful package mangler.  If you do not know it, you will not know exherbo, too.  So you should try exherbo or you never will need `truckle`.

`truckle` will do thing, which `cave` will never do, for example uses a pager automaticaly for longer output.  Useful if you want to install many packages.  And will use `sudo` if needed.

Why did not `cave` provide these things?  It's unclean and it should be clean.  While `cave` is a very powerful package mangler, `truckle` is a smart tool for often used functions of `cave`
